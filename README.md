# tauri-dtl
A Tauri desktop app I wrote for my workstudy that easily distributes files across lab machines  
- Basically just a better version of the [Electron app I made](https://github.com/alexander-kang/electron-dtl) (size went from 200+ MB to ~3 MB, runs from a single exe, significantly less memory consumption, slightly faster)  
- Still in production but basic functionality exists as of now
